# Sparklyr (dev)

- Updates the Spark versions to use for CI

- `sdf_sql()` now returns nothing, including an error, when the query outputs an
empty dataset (#3439)

- `spark_read_source()` now allows setting no path using `path = NA` (#3469)

# Sparklyr 1.8.6

- Addresses issues with R 4.4.0. The root cause was that version checking functions
changed how the work. 
  - `package_version()` no longer accepts `numeric_version()` output. Wrapped
  the `package_version()` function to coerce the argument if it's a
  `numeric_version` class
  - Comparison operators (`<`, `>=`, etc.) for `packageVersion()` do no longer accept numeric values.
  The changes were to pass the version as a character

- Adding support for Databricks "[autoloader](https://docs.databricks.com/en/ingestion/auto-loader/options.html)" (format: `cloudFiles`) for streaming ingestion of files(`stream_read_cloudfiles`)(@zacdav-db #3432):
  - `stream_write_table()`
  - `stream_read_table()`

- Made changes to `stream_write_generic` (@zacdav-db #3432):
  - `toTable` method doesn't allow calling `start`, added `to_table` param that adjusts logic
  - `path` option not propagated when `to_table` is `TRUE`

- Upgrades to Roxygen version 7.3.1 


# Sparklyr 1.8.5

### Fixes

- Fixes quoting issue with `dbplyr` 2.5.0 (#3429)

- Fixes Windows OS identification (#3426)

### Package improvements

- Removes dependency on `tibble`, all calls are now redirected to `dplyr` (#3399)

- Removes dependency on `rapddirs` (#3401): 
  - Backwards compatibility with `sparklyr` 0.5 is no longer needed
  - Replicates selection of cache directory 

- Converts `spark_apply()` to a method (#3418)

### Spark improvements

- Spark 2.3 is no longer considered maintained as of September 2019
  - Removes Java folder for versions 2.3 and below
  - Merges Scala file sets into Spark version 2.4
  - Re-compiles JARs for version 2.4 and above

- Updates Delta-to-Spark version matching when using `delta` as one of the
`packages` when connecting (#3414)

# Sparklyr 1.8.4

### Compatability with new `dbplyr` version

- Fixes `db_connection_describe()` S3 consistency error (@t-kalinowski)

- Addresses new error from `dbplyr` that fails when you try to access 
components from a remote `tbl` using `$`
 
- Bumps the version of `dbplyr` to switch between the two methods to create
temporary tables 

- Addresses new `translate_sql()` hard requirement to pass a `con` object. Done
by passing the current connection or `simulate_hive()` 

### Fixes

- Small fix to spark_connect_method() arguments. Removes 'hadoop_version'

- Improvements to handling `pysparklyr` load (@t-kalinowski)

- Fixes 'subscript out of bounds' issue found by `pysparklyr` (@t-kalinowski)

- Updates available Spark download links

### Improvements

- Removes dependency on the following packages:
  - `digest`
  - `base64enc`
  - `ellipsis`
  
- Converts `ml_fit()` into a S3 method for `pysparklyr` compatibility

### Test improvements

- Improvements and fixes to tests (@t-kalinowski)

- Fixes test jobs that include should have included Arrow but did not

- Updates to the Spark versions to be tested 

- Re-adds tests for development `dbplyr`

# Sparklyr 1.8.3

### Improvements

- Spark error message relays are now cached instead of the entire content
displayed as an R error. This used to overwhelm the interactive session's 
console or Notebook, because of the amount of lines returned by the
Spark message.  Now, by default, it will return the top of the Spark 
error message, which is typically the most relevant part. The full error can
still be accessed using a new function called `spark_last_error()`

- Reduces redundancy on several tests

- Handles SQL quoting when the table reference contains multiple levels. The 
common time someone would encounter an issue is when a table name is passed
using `in_catalog()`, or `in_schema()`. 

### Java

- Adds Scala scripts to handle changes in the upcoming version of Spark (3.5)
- Adds new JAR file to handle Spark 3.0 to 3.4
- Adds new JAR file to handle Spark 3.5 and above

### Fixes

- It prevents an error when `na.rm = TRUE` is explicitly set within `pmax()` and
`pmin()`. It will now also purposely fail if `na.rm` is set to `FALSE`. The
default of these functions in base R is for `na.rm` to be `FALSE`, but ever
since these functions were released, there has been no warning or error. For now,
we will keep that behavior until a better approach can be figured out. (#3353)

- `spark_install()` will now properly match when a partial version is passed 
to the function. The issue was that passing '2.3' would match to '3.2.3', instead
of '2.3.x' (#3370)

### Package integration

- Adds functionality to allow other packages to provide `sparklyr` additional 
back-ends. This effort is mainly focused on adding the ability to integrate 
with Spark Connect and Databricks Connect through a new package. 

- New exported functions to integrate with the RStudio IDE. They all have the
same `spark_ide_` prefix

- Modifies several read functions to become exported methods, such as 
`sdf_read_column()`. 

- Adds `spark_integ_test_skip()` function. This is to allow other packages 
to use `sparklyr`'s test suite. It enables a way to the external package to 
indicate if a given test should run or be skipped.

- If installed, `sparklyr` will load the `pysparklyr` package

# Sparklyr 1.8.2

### New Features

- Adds Azure Synapse Analytics connectivity (@Bob-Chou , #3336)

- Adds support for "parameterized" queries now available in Spark 3.4 (@gregleleu #3335)

- Adds new DBI methods: `dbValid` and `dbDisconnect` (@alibell, #3296)

- Adds `overwrite` parameter to `dbWriteTable()` (@alibell, #3296)

- Adds `database` parameter to `dbListTables()` (@alibell, #3296)

- Adds ability to turn off predicate support (where(), across()) using 
  options("sparklyr.support.predicates" = FALSE). Defaults to TRUE. This should
  accelerate `dplyr` commands because it won't need to process column types
  for every single piped command

### Fixes

- Fixes Spark download locations (#3331)

- Fix various rlang deprecation warnings (@mgirlich, #3333).

### Misc

- Switches upper version of Spark to 3.4, and updates JARS (#3334)


# Sparklyr 1.8.1

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes consistency issues with dplyr's sample_n(), slice(), op_vars(), and sample_frac()

### Internal functionality

- Adds R-devel to GHA testing

# Sparklyr 1.8.0

### Bug Fixes

- Addresses Warning from CRAN checks

- Addresses option(stringsAsFactors) usage

- Fixes root cause of issue processing pivot wider and distinct (#3317 & #3320)

- Updates local Spark download sources

# Sparklyr 1.7.9

### Bug Fixes

- Better resolves intermediate column names when using `dplyr` verbs for
  data transformation (#3286)
  
- Fixes `pivot_wider()` issues with simpler cases (#3289)

- Updates Spark download locations (#3298)

- Better resolution of intermediate column names (#3286)

# Sparklyr 1.7.8

### New features

- Adds new metric extraction functions: `ml_metrics_binary()`, 
  `ml_metrics_regression()` and `ml_metrics_multiclass()`. They work closer to 
  how `yardstick` metric extraction functions work. They expect a table with 
  the predictions and actual values, and returns a concise `tibble` with the 
  metrics. (#3281)
  
- Adds new `spark_insert_table()` function. This allows one to insert data into 
  an existing table definition without redefining the table, even when overwriting 
  the existing data. (#3272 @jimhester)

### Bug Fixes

- Restores "validator" functions to regression models. Removing them in a previous
  version broke `ml_cross_validator()` for regression models. (#3273)

### Spark 

- Adds support to Spark 3.3 local installation. This includes the ability to 
  enable and setup log4j version 2. (#3269)

- Updates the JSON file that `sparklyr` uses to find and download Spark for
  local use.  It is worth mentioning that starting with Spark 3.3, the Hadoop
  version number is no longer using a minor version for its download link. So, 
  instead of requesting 3.2, the version to request is 3. 

### Internal functionality

- Removes workaround for older versions of `arrow`. Bumps `arrow` version 
  dependency, from 0.14.0 to 0.17.0 (#3283 @nealrichardson)

- Removes code related to backwards compatibility with `dbplyr`. `sparklyr`
  requires `dbplyr` version 2.2.1 or above, so the code is no longer needed. 
  (#3277)

- Begins centralizing ML parameter validation into a single function that will
  run the proper `cast` function for each Spark parameter.  It also starts using
  S3 methods, instead of searching for a concatenated function name, to find the
  proper parameter validator.  Regression models are the first ones to use this
  new method. (#3279)

- `sparklyr` compilation routines have been improved and simplified.  
  `spark_compile()` now provides more informative output when used.  It also adds
  tests to compilation to make sure. It also adds a step to install Scala in the 
  corresponding GHAs. This is so that the new JAR build tests are able to run. 
  (#3275)

- Stops using package environment variables directly. Any package level variable
  will be handled by a `genv` prefixed function to set and retrieve values.  This
  avoids the risk of having the exact same variable initialized on more than on
  R script. (#3274)

- Adds more tests to improve coverage.

### Misc

- Addresses new CRAN HTML check NOTEs. It also adds a new GHA action to run the 
  same checks to make sure we avoid new issues with this in the future.

# Sparklyr 1.7.7

### dplyr

- Makes sure to run previous `dplyr` actions before sampling (#3276)

### Misc

- Ensures compatibility with the upcoming, and current, versions of `dbplyr`

# Sparklyr 1.7.6

### Misc

- Ensures compatibility with Spark version 3.2 (#3261)

- Compatibility with new `dbplyr` version (@mgirlich)

- Removes `stringr` dependency 

- Fixes `augment()` when the model was fitted via `parsnip` (#3233)

# Sparklyr 1.7.5

### Misc

- Addresses deprecation of `rlang::is_env()` function. (@lionel- #3217)

- Updates `pivot_wider()` to support new version of `tidyr` (@DavisVaughan #3215)

# Sparklyr 1.7.4

### Misc

- Edgar Ruiz (https://github.com/edgararuiz) will be the new maintainer of
  {sparklyr} moving forward.

# Sparklyr 1.7.3

### Data

- Implemented support for the `.groups` parameter for `dplyr::summarize()`
  operations on Spark dataframes

- Fixed the incorrect handling of the `remove = TRUE` option for
  `separate.tbl_spark()`

- Optimized away an extra count query when collecting Spark dataframes from
  Spark to R.

### Misc

- By default, use links from the https://dlcdn.apache.org site for downloading
  Apache Spark when possible.

- Attempt to continue `spark_install()` process even if the Spark version
  specified is not present in `inst/extdata/versions*.json` files (in which
  case `sparklyr` will guess the URL of the tar ball based on the existing
  and well-known naming convention used by https://archive.apache.org, i.e.,
  https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-${spark version}/spark-${spark version}-bin-hadoop${hadoop version}.tgz)

- Revised `inst/extdata/versions*.json` files to reflect recent releases of
  Apache Spark.

- Implemented `sparklyr_get_backend_port()` for querying the port number used
  by the `sparklyr` backend.

# Sparklyr 1.7.2

### Connections

- Added support for notebook-scoped libraries on Databricks connections.
  R library tree paths (i.e., those returned from `.libPaths()`) are now shared
  between driver and worker in sparklyr for Databricks connection use cases.

- Java version validation function of `sparklyr` was revised to be able to parse
  `java -version` outputs containing only major version or outputs containing
  data values.

- Spark configuration logic was revised to ensure "sparklyr.cores.local" takes
  precedence over "sparklyr.connect.cores.local", as the latter is deprecated.

- Renamed "sparklyr.backend.threads" (an undocumented, non-user-facing,
  `sparklyr` internal-only configuration) to "spark.sparklyr-backend.threads" so
  that it has the required "spark." prefix and is configurable through
  `sparklyr::spark_config()`.

- For Spark 2.0 or above, if `org.apache.spark.SparkEnv.get()` returns a non-
  null env object, then `sparklyr` will use that env object to configure
  "spark.sparklyr-backend.threads".

- Support for running custom callbacks before the `sparklyr` backend starts
  processing JVM method calls was added for Databricks-related use cases, which
  will be useful for implementing ADL credential pass-through.

### Data

- Revised `spark_write_delta()` to use `delta.io` library version 1.0 when
  working with Apache Spark 3.1 or above.

- Fixed a problem with `dbplyr::remote_name()` returning `NULL` on Spark
  dataframes returned from a `dplyr::arrange()` operation followed by
  `dplyr::compute()` (e.g.,
  `<a spark_dataframe> %>% arrange(<some column>) %>% compute()`).

- Implemented `tidyr::replace_na()` interface for Spark dataframes.

- The `n_distinct()` summarizer for Spark dataframes was revised substantially
  to properly support `na.rm = TRUE` or `na.rm = FALSE` use cases when
  performing `dplyr::summarize(<colname> = n_distinct(...))` types of operations
  on Spark dataframes.

- Spark data interface functions that create Spark dataframes will no longer
  check whether any Spark dataframe with identical name exists when the
  dataframe being created has a randomly generated name (as randomly generated
  table name will contain a UUID and any chance of name collision is vanishingly
  small).

### Documentation

- Create usage example for `ml_prefixspan()`.

# Sparklyr 1.7.1

### Connections

- Fixed an issue with connecting to Apache Spark 3.1 or above.

# Sparklyr 1.7.0

### Data

- Revised `tidyr::fill()` implementation to respect any 'ORDER BY' clause from
  the input while ensuring the same 'ORDER BY' operation is never duplicated
  twice in the generated Spark SQL query

- Helper functions such as `sdf_rbeta()`, `sdf_rbinom()`, etc were implemented
  for generating Spark dataframes containing i.i.d. samples from commonly used
  probability distributions.

- Fixed a bug with `compute.tbl_spark()`'s handling of positional args.

- Fixed a bug that previously affected `dplyr::tbl()` when the source table
  is specified using `dbplyr::in_schema()`.

- Internal calls to `sdf_schema.tbl_spark()` and `spark_dataframe.tbl_spark()`
  are memoized to reduce performance overhead from repeated `spark_invoke()`s.

- `spark_read_image()` was implemented to support image files as data sources.

- `spark_read_binary()` was implemented to support binary data sources.

- A specialized version of `tbl_ptype()` was implemented so that no data will be
  collected from Spark to R when `dplyr` calls `tbl_ptype()` on a Spark
  dataframe.

- Added support for `database` parameter to `src_tbls.spark_connection()`
  (e.g., `src_tbls(sc, database = "default")` where `sc` is a Spark connection).

- Fixed a null pointer issue with `spark_read_jdbc()` and `spark_write_jdbc()`.

### Distributed R

- `spark_apply()` was improved to support `tibble` inputs containing list
  columns.

- Spark dataframes created by `spark_apply()` will be cached by default to
  avoid re-computations.

- `spark_apply()` and `do_spark()` now support `qs` and custom serializations.

- The experimental `auto_deps = TRUE` mode was implemented for `spark_apply()`
  to infer required R packages for the closure, and to only copy required R
  packages to Spark worker nodes when executing the closure.

### Extensions

- Sparklyr extensions can now customize dbplyr SQL translator env used by
  `sparklyr` by supplying their own dbplyr SQL variant when calling
  `spark_dependency()` (see
  https://github.com/r-spark/sparklyr.sedona/blob/1455d3dea51ad16114a8112f2990ec542458aee2/R/dependencies.R#L38
  for an example).

- `jarray()` was implemented to convert a R vector into an `Array[T]` reference.
  A reference returned by `jarray()` can be passed to `invoke*` family of
  functions requiring an `Array[T]` as a parameter where T is some type that is
  more specific than `java.lang.Object`.

- `jfloat()` function was implemented to cast any numeric type in R to
  `java.lang.Float`.

- `jfloat_array()` was implemented to instantiate `Array[java.lang.Float]` from
  numeric values in R.

### Serialization

- Added null checks that were previously missing when collecting array columns
  from Spark dataframe to R.

- `array<byte>` and `array<boolean>` columns in a Spark dataframe will be
  collected as `raw()` and `logical()` vectors, respectively, in R rather than
  integer arrays.

- Fixed a bug that previously caused invoke params containing `NaN`s to be
  serialized incorrectly.

### Spark ML

- `ml_compute_silhouette_measure()` was implemented to evaluate the
  [Silhouette measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette_(clustering)) of
  k-mean clustering results.

- `spark_read_libsvm()` now supports specifications of additional options via
  the `options` parameter. Additional libsvm data source options currently
  supported by Spark include `numFeatures` and `vectorType` (see
  https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/java/org/apache/spark/ml/source/libsvm/LibSVMDataSource.html).

- `ml_linear_svc()` will emit a warning if `weight_col` is specified while
  working with Spark 3.0 or above, as it is no longer supported in recent
  versions of Spark.

- Fixed an issue with `ft_one_hot_encoder.ml_pipeline()` not working as
  expected.

# Sparklyr 1.6.3

### Data

- Reduced the number of `invoke()` calls needed for `sdf_schema()` to avoid
  performance issues when processing Spark dataframes with non-trivial number
  of columns

- Implement memoization for `spark_dataframe.tbl_spark()` and
  `sdf_schema.tbl_spark()` to reduce performance overhead for some `dplyr` use
  cases involving Spark dataframes with non-trivial number of columns

# Sparklyr 1.6.2

### Data

- A previous bug fix related to `dplyr::compute()` caching a Spark view needed
  to be further revised to take effect with dbplyr backend API edition 2

# Sparklyr 1.6.1

### Data

- `sdf_distinct()` is implemented to be an R interface for `distinct()` operation
  on Spark dataframes (NOTE: this is different from the `dplyr::distinct()`
  operation, as `dplyr::distinct()` operation on a Spark dataframe now supports
  `.keep_all = TRUE` and has more complex ordering requirements)

- Fixed a problem of some expressions being evaluated twice in
  `transmute.tbl_spark()` (see tidyverse/dbplyr#605)

- `dbExistsTable()` now performs case insensitive comparison with table names to
  be consistent with how table names are handled by Spark catalog API

- Fixed a bug with `sql_query_save()` not overwriting a temp table with identical
  name

- Revised `sparklyr:::process_tbl_name()` to correctly handle inputs that are not
  table names

- Bug fix: `db_save_query.spark_connection()` should also cache the view it
  created in Spark

# Sparklyr 1.6.0

### Data

- Made `sparklyr` compatible with both dbplyr edition 1 and edition 2 APIs

- Revised `sparklyr`'s integration with `dbplyr` API so that `dplyr::select()`,
  `dplyr::mutate()`, and `dplyr::summarize()` verbs on Spark dataframes
  involving `where()` predicates can be correctly translated to Spark SQL
  (e.g., one can have `sdf %>% select(where(is.numeric))` and
  `sdf %>% summarize(across(starts_with("Petal"), mean))`, etc)

- Implemented `dplyr::if_all()` and `dplyr::if_any()` support for Spark
  dataframes

- Added support for `partition_by` option in `stream_write_*` methods

- Fixed a bug with URI handling affecting all `spark_read_*` methods

- Avoided repeated creations of SimpleDataFormat objects and setTimeZone calls
  while collecting Data columns from a Spark dataframe

- Schema specification for struct columns in `spark_read_*()` methods are now
  supported (e.g.,
  `spark_read_json(sc, path, columns = list(s = list(a = "integer, b = "double")))`
  says expect a struct column named `s` with each element containing a field
  named `a` and a field named `b`)

- `sdf_quantile()` and `ft_quantile_discretizer()` now support approximation of
  weighted quantiles using a modified version of the Greenwald-Khanna algorithm
  that takes relative weight of each data point into consideration.

- Fixed a problem of some expressions being evaluated twice in
  `transmute.tbl_spark()` (see tidyverse/dbplyr#605)

- Made `dplyr::distinct()` behavior for Spark dataframes configurable:
  setting `options(sparklyr.dplyr_distinct.impl = "tbl_lazy)` will switch
  `dplyr::distinct()` implementation to a basic one that only adds ‘DISTINCT’
  clause to the current Spark SQL query, does not support the `.keep_all = TRUE`
  option, and (3) does not have any ordering guarantee for the output.

### Serialization

- `spark_write_rds()` was implemented to support exporting all partitions of a
  Spark dataframe in parallel into RDS (version 2) files. Such RDS files will be
  written to the default file system of the Spark instance (i.e., local file if
  the Spark instance is running locally, or a distributed file system such as
  HDFS if the Spark instance is deployed over a cluster). The resulting RDS
  files, once downloaded onto the local file system, should be deserialized into
  R dataframes using `collect_from_rds()` (which calls `readRDS()` internally
  and also performs some important post-processing steps to support timestamp
  columns, date columns, and struct columns properly in R).

- `copy_to()` can now import list columns of temporal values within a R
  dataframe as arrays of Spark SQL date/timestamp types when working with Spark
  3.0 or above

- Fixed a bug with `copy_to()`'s handling of NA values in list columns of a R
  dataframe

- Spark map type will be collected as list instead of environment in R in order
  to support empty string as key

- Fixed a configuration-related bug in `sparklyr:::arrow_enabled()`

- Implemented spark-apply-specific configuration option for Arrow max records
  per batch, which can be different from the
  `spark.sql.execution.arrow.maxRecordsPerBatch` value from Spark session config

### Connections

- Created convenience functions for working with Spark runtime configurations

- Fixed buggy exit code from the `spark-submit` process launched by sparklyr

### Spark ML

- Implemented R interface for Power Iteration Clustering

- The `handle_invalid` option is added to `ft_vector_indexer()` (supported by
  Spark 2.3 or above)

### Misc

- Fixed a bug with `~` within some path components not being normalized in
  `sparklyr::livy_install()`

# Sparklyr 1.5.2

### Connections

- Fixed `op_vars()` specification in `dplyr::distinct()` verb for Spark
  dataframes

- `spark_disconnect()` now closes the Spark monitoring connection correctly

### Data

- Implement support for stratified sampling in `ft_dplyr_transformer()`

- Added support for `na.rm` in dplyr `rowSums()` function for Spark dataframes

# Sparklyr 1.5.1

### Connections

- A bug in how multiple `--conf` values were handled in some scenarios within
  the spark-submit shell args which was introduced in sparklyr 1.4 has been
  fixed now.

- A bug with `livy.jars` configuration was fixed (#2843)

### Data

- `tbl()` methods were revised to be compatible with `dbplyr` 2.0 when handling
  inputs of the form `"<schema name>.<table name>"`

# Sparklyr 1.5.0

### Connections

- `spark_web()` has been revised to work correctly in environments such as
  RStudio Server or RStudio Cloud where the Spark web UI URLs such as
  "http://localhost:4040/jobs/" needs to be translated with
  `rstudioapi::translateLocalUrl()` to be accessible.

- The problem with bundle file name collisions when `session_id` is not provided
  has been fixed in `spark_apply_bundle()`.

- Support for `sparklyr.livy.sources` is removed completely as it is no longer
  needed as a workaround when Spark version is specified.

### Data

- `stream_lag()` is implemented to provide the equivalent functionality of
  `dplyr::lag()` for streaming Spark dataframes while also supporting additional
  filtering of "outdated" records based on timestamp threshold.

- A specialized version of `dplyr::distinct()` is implemented for Spark
  dataframes that supports `.keep_all = TRUE` and correctly satisfies the "rows
  are a subset of the input but appear in the same order" requirement stated in
  the `dplyr` documentation.

- The default value for the `repartition` parameter of `sdf_seq()` has been
  corrected.

- Some implementation detail was revised to make `sparklyr` 1.5 fully compatible
  with `dbplyr` 2.0.

- `sdf_expand_grid()` was implemented to support roughly the equivalent of
  `expand.grid()` for Spark dataframes while also offering additional Spark-
  specific options such as broadcast hash joins, repartitioning, and caching of
  the resulting Spark dataframe in memory.

- `sdf_quantile()` now supports calculation for multiple columns.

- Both `lead()` and `lag()` methods for dplyr interface of `sparklyr` are fixed
  to correctly accept the `order_by` parameter.

- The `cumprod()` window aggregation function for dplyr was reimplemented to
  correctly handle null values in Spark dataframes.

- Support for `missing` parameter is implemented for the `ifelse()`/`if_else()`
  function for dplyr.

- A `weighted.mean()` summarizer was implemented for dplyr interface of
  `sparklyr`.

- A workaround was created to ensure `NA_real_` is handled correctly within the
  contexts of `dplyr::mutate()` and `dplyr::transmute()` methods (e.g.,
  `sdf %>% dplyr::mutate(z = NA_real_)` should result in a column named "z" with
  double-precision SQL type)

- Support for R-like subsetting operator (`[`) was implemented for selecting a
  subset of columns from a Spark dataframe.

- The `rowSums()` function was implemented for dplyr interface of `sparklyr`.

- The `sdf_partition_sizes()` function was created to enable efficient query of
  partition sizes within a Spark dataframe.

- Stratified sampling for Spark dataframes has been implemented and can be
  expressed using dplyr grammar as
  `<spark dataframe> %>% dplyr::group_by(<columns>) %>% dplyr::sample_n(...)` or
  `<spark dataframe> %>% dplyr::group_by(<columns>) %>% dplyr::sample_frac(...)`
  where `<columns>` is a list of grouping column(s) defining the strata
  (i.e., the sampling specified by `dplyr::sample_n()` or `dplyr::sample_frac()`
  will be applied to each group defined by `dplyr::group_by(<columns>)`)

- The implementations of `dplyr::sample_n()` and `dplyr::sample_frac()` have
  been revised to first perform aggregations on individual partitions before
  merging aggregated results from all partitions, which is more efficient than
  `mapPartitions()` followed by `reduce()`.

- `sdf_unnest_longer()` and `sdf_unnest_wider()` were implemented and offer
  the equivalents of `tidyr::unnest_longer()` and `tidyr::unnest_wider()` for
  for Spark dataframes.

### Serialization

- `copy_to()` now serializes R dataframes into RDS format instead of CSV format
  if `arrow` is unavailable. RDS serialization is approximately 48% faster than
  CSV and allows multiple correctness issues related to CSV serialization to be
  fixed easily in `sparklyr`.

- `copy_to()` and `collect()` now correctly preserve `NA_real_` (`NA_real_` from
  a R dataframe, once translated as `null` in a Spark dataframe, used to be
  incorrectly collected as `NaN` in previous versions of `sparklyr`).

- `copy_to()` can now distinguish `"NA"` from `NA` as expected.

- `copy_to()` now supports importing binary columns from R dataframes to Spark.

- Reduced serialization overhead in Spark-based `foreach` parallel backend
  created with `registerDoSpark()`.

# Sparklyr 1.4.0

### Connections

- RAPIDS GPU acceleration plugin can now be enabled with
  `spark_connect(..., package = "rapids")` and configured with `spark_config`
  options prefixed with "spark.rapids."

- Enabled support for http{,s} proxy plus additional CURL options for Livy
  connections

- In sparklyr error message, suggest `options(sparklyr.log.console = TRUE)` as a
  trouble-shooting step whenever the "sparklyr gateway not responding" error
  occurs

- Addressed an inter-op issue with Livy + Spark 2.4
  (https://github.com/sparklyr/sparklyr/issues/2641)

- Fix race-condition first time `spark_apply()` is run when more
  than one partition runs in a worker and both processes try to
  unpack the packages bundle at the same time.

- `spark_apply()` now adds generic column names when needed and
  validates `f` is a `function`.

- Improved documentation and error cases for `metric` argument in
  `ml_classification_eval()` and `ml_binary_classification_eval()`.

- Fix to `spark_install()` to use the `/logs` subfolder to store local
  `log4j` logs.

- Fix to `spark_apply()` when R is used from a worker node since worker

  generic closures provided by the `rlang` package.

- Added config options `sparklyr.worker.gateway.address` and
  `sparklyr.worker.gateway.port` to configure gateway used under
  worker nodes.

- Added `group_by` parameter to `spark_apply()`, to support operations
  over groups of dataframes.

- Added `spark_apply()`, allowing users to use R code to directly
  manipulate and transform Spark DataFrames.

### External Data

- Added `spark_write_source()`. This function writes data into a
  Spark data source which can be loaded through an Spark package.

- Added `spark_write_jdbc()`. This function writes from a Spark DataFrame
  into a JDBC connection.

- Added `columns` parameter to `spark_read_*()` functions to load data with
  named columns or explicit column types.

- Added `partition_by` parameter to `spark_write_csv()`, `spark_write_json()`,
  `spark_write_table()` and `spark_write_parquet()`.

- Added `spark_read_source()`. This function reads data from a
  Spark data source which can be loaded through an Spark package.

- Added support for `mode = "overwrite"` and `mode = "append"` to
  `spark_write_csv()`.

- `spark_write_table()` now supports saving to default Hive path.

- Improved performance of `spark_read_csv()` reading remote data when
  `infer_schema = FALSE`.

- Added `spark_read_jdbc()`. This function reads from a JDBC connection
  into a Spark DataFrame.

- Renamed `spark_load_table()` and `spark_save_table()` into `spark_read_table()`
  and `spark_write_table()` for consistency with existing `spark_read_*()` and
  `spark_write_*()` functions.

- Added support to specify a vector of column names in `spark_read_csv()` to
  specify column names without having to set the type of each column.

- Improved `copy_to()`, `sdf_copy_to()` and `dbWriteTable()` performance under
  `yarn-client` mode.

### dplyr

- Support for `cumprod()` to calculate cumulative products.

- Support for `cor()`, `cov()`, `sd()` and `var()` as window functions.

- Support for Hive built-in operators `%like%`, `%rlike%`, and
  `%regexp%` for matching regular expressions in `filter()` and `mutate()`.

- Support for dplyr (>= 0.6) which among many improvements, increases
  performance in some queries by making use of a new query optimizer.

- `sample_frac()` takes a fraction instead of a percent to match dplyr.

- Improved performance of `sample_n()` and `sample_frac()` through the use of
  `TABLESAMPLE` in the generated query.

### Databases

- Added `src_databases()`. This function list all the available databases.

- Added `tbl_change_db()`. This function changes current database.

### DataFrames

- Added `sdf_len()`, `sdf_seq()` and `sdf_along()` to help generate numeric
  sequences as Spark DataFrames.

- Added `spark_set_checkpoint_dir()`, `spark_get_checkpoint_dir()`, and
  `sdf_checkpoint()` to enable checkpointing.

- Added `sdf_broadcast()` which can be used to hint the query
  optimizer to perform a broadcast join in cases where a shuffle
  hash join is planned but not optimal.

- Added `sdf_repartition()`, `sdf_coalesce()`, and `sdf_num_partitions()`
  to support repartitioning and getting the number of partitions of Spark
  DataFrames.

- Added `sdf_bind_rows()` and `sdf_bind_cols()` -- these functions
  are the `sparklyr` equivalent of `dplyr::bind_rows()` and
  `dplyr::bind_cols()`.

- Added `sdf_separate_column()` -- this function allows one to separate
  components of an array / vector column into separate scalar-valued
  columns.

- `sdf_with_sequential_id()` now supports `from` parameter to choose the
  starting value of the id column.

- Added `sdf_pivot()`. This function provides a mechanism for constructing
  pivot tables, using Spark's 'groupBy' + 'pivot' functionality, with a
  formula interface similar to that of `reshape2::dcast()`.

### MLlib

- Added `vocabulary.only` to `ft_count_vectorizer()` to retrieve the
  vocabulary with ease.

- GLM type models now support `weights.column` to specify weights in model
  fitting. (#217)

- `ml_logistic_regression()` now supports multinomial regression, in
  addition to binomial regression [requires Spark 2.1.0 or greater]. (#748)

- Implemented `residuals()` and `sdf_residuals()` for Spark linear
  regression and GLM models. The former returns a R vector while
  the latter returns a `tbl_spark` of training data with a `residuals`
  column added.

- Added `ml_model_data()`, used for extracting data associated with
  Spark ML models.

- The `ml_save()` and `ml_load()` functions gain a `meta` argument, allowing
  users to specify where R-level model metadata should be saved independently
  of the Spark model itself. This should help facilitate the saving and loading
  of Spark models used in non-local connection scenarios.

- `ml_als_factorization()` now supports the implicit matrix factorization
   and nonnegative least square options.

- Added `ft_count_vectorizer()`. This function can be used to transform
  columns of a Spark DataFrame so that they might be used as input to `ml_lda()`.
  This should make it easier to invoke `ml_lda()` on Spark data sets.

### Broom

- Implemented `tidy()`, `augment()`, and `glance()` from tidyverse/broom for
  `ml_model_generalized_linear_regression` and `ml_model_linear_regression`
  models.

### R Compatibility

- Implemented `cbind.tbl_spark()`. This method works by first generating
  index columns using `sdf_with_sequential_id()` then performing `inner_join()`.
  Note that dplyr `_join()` functions should still be used for DataFrames
  with common keys since they are less expensive.

### Connections

- Increased default number of concurrent connections by setting default for
  `spark.port.maxRetries` from 16 to 128.

- Support for gateway connections `sparklyr://hostname:port/session` and using
  `spark-submit --class sparklyr.Shell sparklyr-2.1-2.11.jar <port> <id> --remote`.

- Added support for `sparklyr.gateway.service` and `sparklyr.gateway.remote` to
  enable/disable the gateway in service and to accept remote connections required
  for Yarn Cluster mode.

- Added support for Yarn Cluster mode using `master = "yarn-cluster"`. Either,
  explicitly set `config = list(sparklyr.gateway.address = "<driver-name>")` or
  implicitly `sparklyr` will read the `site-config.xml` for the `YARN_CONF_DIR`
  environment variable.

- Added `spark_context_config()` and `hive_context_config()` to retrieve
  runtime configurations for the Spark and Hive contexts.

- Added `sparklyr.log.console` to redirect logs to console, useful
  to troubleshooting `spark_connect`.

- Added `sparklyr.backend.args` as config option to enable passing
  parameters to the `sparklyr` backend.

- Improved logging while establishing connections to `sparklyr`.

- Improved `spark_connect()` performance.

- Implemented new configuration checks to proactively report connection errors
  in Windows.

- While connecting to spark from Windows, setting the `sparklyr.verbose` option
  to `TRUE` prints detailed configuration steps.

- Added `custom_headers` to `livy_config()` to add custom headers to the REST call
  to the Livy server

### Compilation

- Added support for `jar_dep` in the compilation specification to
  support additional `jars` through `spark_compile()`.

- `spark_compile()` now prints deprecation warnings.

- Added `download_scalac()` to assist downloading all the Scala compilers
  required to build using `compile_package_jars` and provided support for
  using any `scalac` minor versions while looking for the right compiler.

### Backend

- Improved backend logging by adding type and session id prefix.

### Miscellaneous

- `copy_to()` and `sdf_copy_to()` auto generate a `name` when an expression
  can't be transformed into a table name.

- Implemented `type_sum.jobj()` (from tibble) to enable better printing of jobj
  objects embedded in data frames.

- Added the `spark_home_set()` function, to help facilitate the setting of the
  `SPARK_HOME` environment variable. This should prove useful in teaching
  environments, when teaching the basics of Spark and sparklyr.

- Added support for the `sparklyr.ui.connections` option, which adds additional
  connection options into the new connections dialog. The
  `rstudio.spark.connections` option is now deprecated.

- Implemented the "New Connection Dialog" as a Shiny application to be able to
  support newer versions of RStudio that deprecate current connections UI.

### Bug Fixes

- When using `spark_connect()` in local clusters, it validates that `java` exists
  under `JAVA_HOME` to help troubleshoot systems that have an incorrect `JAVA_HOME`.

- Improved `argument is of length zero` error triggered while retrieving data
  with no columns to display.

- Fixed `Path does not exist` referencing `hdfs` exception during `copy_to` under
  systems configured with `HADOOP_HOME`.

- Fixed session crash after "No status is returned" error by terminating
  invalid connection and added support to print log trace during this error.

- `compute()` now caches data in memory by default. To revert this beavior use
  `sparklyr.dplyr.compute.nocache` set to `TRUE`.

- `spark_connect()` with `master = "local"` and a given `version` overrides
  `SPARK_HOME` to avoid existing installation mismatches.

- Fixed `spark_connect()` under Windows issue when `newInstance0` is present in
  the logs.

- Fixed collecting `long` type columns when NAs are present (#463).

- Fixed backend issue that affects systems where `localhost` does
  not resolve properly to the loopback address.

- Fixed issue collecting data frames containing newlines `\n`.

- Spark Null objects (objects of class NullType) discovered within numeric
  vectors are now collected as NAs, rather than lists of NAs.

- Fixed warning while connecting with livy and improved 401 message.

- Fixed issue in `spark_read_parquet()` and other read methods in which
  `spark_normalize_path()` would not work in some platforms while loading
  data using custom protocols like `s3n://` for Amazon S3.

- Resolved issue in `spark_save()` / `load_table()` to support saving / loading
  data and added path parameter in `spark_load_table()` for consistency with
  other functions.

# Sparklyr 0.5.5

- Implemented support for `connectionViewer` interface required in RStudio 1.1
  and `spark_connect` with `mode="databricks"`.

# Sparklyr 0.5.4

- Implemented support for `dplyr 0.6` and Spark 2.1.x.

# Sparklyr 0.5.3

- Implemented support for `DBI 0.6`.

# Sparklyr 0.5.2

- Fix to `spark_connect` affecting Windows users and Spark 1.6.x.

- Fix to Livy connections which would cause connections to fail while connection
  is on 'waiting' state.

# Sparklyr 0.5.0

- Implemented basic authorization for Livy connections using
  `livy_config_auth()`.

- Added support to specify additional `spark-submit` parameters using the
  `sparklyr.shell.args` environment variable.

- Renamed `sdf_load()` and `sdf_save()` to `spark_read()` and `spark_write()`
  for consistency.

- The functions `tbl_cache()` and `tbl_uncache()` can now be using without
  requiring the `dplyr` namespace to be loaded.

- `spark_read_csv(..., columns = <...>, header = FALSE)` should now work as
  expected -- previously, `sparklyr` would still attempt to normalize the
  column names provided.

- Support to configure Livy using the `livy.` prefix in the `config.yml` file.

- Implemented experimental support for Livy through: `livy_install()`,
  `livy_service_start()`, `livy_service_stop()` and
  `spark_connect(method = "livy")`.

- The `ml` routines now accept `data` as an optional argument, to support
  calls of the form e.g. `ml_linear_regression(y ~ x, data = data)`. This
  should be especially helpful in conjunction with `dplyr::do()`.

- Spark `DenseVector` and `SparseVector` objects are now deserialized as
  R numeric vectors, rather than Spark objects. This should make it easier
  to work with the output produced by `sdf_predict()` with Random Forest
  models, for example.

- Implemented `dim.tbl_spark()`. This should ensure that `dim()`, `nrow()`
  and `ncol()` all produce the expected result with `tbl_spark`s.

- Improved Spark 2.0 installation in Windows by creating `spark-defaults.conf`
  and configuring `spark.sql.warehouse.dir`.

- Embedded Apache Spark package dependencies to avoid requiring internet
  connectivity while connecting for the first through `spark_connect`. The
  `sparklyr.csv.embedded` config setting was added to configure a regular
  expression to match Spark versions where the embedded package is deployed.

- Increased exception callstack and message length to include full
  error details when an exception is thrown in Spark.

- Improved validation of supported Java versions.

- The `spark_read_csv()` function now accepts the `infer_schema` parameter,
  controlling whether the columns schema should be inferred from the underlying
  file itself. Disabling this should improve performance when the schema is
  known beforehand.

- Added a `do_.tbl_spark` implementation, allowing for the execution of
  `dplyr::do` statements on Spark DataFrames. Currently, the computation is
  performed in serial across the different groups specified on the Spark
  DataFrame; in the future we hope to explore a parallel implementation.
  Note that `do_` always returns a `tbl_df` rather than a `tbl_spark`, as
  the objects produced within a `do_` query may not necessarily be Spark
  objects.

- Improved errors, warnings and fallbacks for unsupported Spark versions.

- `sparklyr` now defaults to `tar = "internal"` in its calls to `untar()`.
  This should help resolve issues some Windows users have seen related to
  an inability to connect to Spark, which ultimately were caused by a lack
  of permissions on the Spark installation.

- Resolved an issue where `copy_to()` and other R => Spark data transfer
  functions could fail when the last column contained missing / empty values.
  (#265)

- Added `sdf_persist()` as a wrapper to the Spark DataFrame `persist()` API.

- Resolved an issue where `predict()` could produce results in the wrong
  order for large Spark DataFrames.

- Implemented support for `na.action` with the various Spark ML routines. The
  value of `getOption("na.action")` is used by default. Users can customize the
  `na.action` argument through the `ml.options` object accepted by all ML
  routines.

- On Windows, long paths, and paths containing spaces, are now supported within
  calls to `spark_connect()`.

- The `lag()` window function now accepts numeric values for `n`. Previously,
  only integer values were accepted. (#249)

- Added support to configure Ppark environment variables using `spark.env.*` config.

- Added support for the `Tokenizer` and `RegexTokenizer` feature transformers.
  These are exported as the `ft_tokenizer()` and `ft_regex_tokenizer()` functions.

- Resolved an issue where attempting to call `copy_to()` with an R `data.frame`
  containing many columns could fail with a Java StackOverflow. (#244)

- Resolved an issue where attempting to call `collect()` on a Spark DataFrame
  containing many columns could produce the wrong result. (#242)

- Added support to parameterize network timeouts using the
  `sparklyr.backend.timeout`, `sparklyr.gateway.start.timeout` and
  `sparklyr.gateway.connect.timeout` config settings.

- Improved logging while establishing connections to `sparklyr`.

- Added `sparklyr.gateway.port` and `sparklyr.gateway.address` as config settings.

- The `spark_log()` function now accepts the `filter` parameter. This can be used
  to filter entries within the Spark log.

- Increased network timeout for `sparklyr.backend.timeout`.

- Moved `spark.jars.default` setting from options to Spark config.

- `sparklyr` now properly respects the Hive metastore directory with the
  `sdf_save_table()` and `sdf_load_table()` APIs for Spark < 2.0.0.

- Added `sdf_quantile()` as a means of computing (approximate) quantiles
  for a column of a Spark DataFrame.

- Added support for `n_distinct(...)` within the `dplyr` interface, based on
  call to Hive function `count(DISTINCT ...)`. (#220)

# Sparklyr 0.4.0

- First release to CRAN.
