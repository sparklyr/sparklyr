# Sparklyr 0.5.0 (UNRELEASED)

- Improved performance when a complex dplyr chain is piped directly into
  ml routines.

- Fixed issue in spark_read_csv when headers=FALSE but columns are provided
  where columns would still get normalized.

- Support to configure Livy using the `livy.` prefix in the `config.yml` file.

- Implemented experimental support for Livy through: `livy_install`, 
  `livy_service_start`, `livy_service_stop` and  `spark_connect(method = "livy")`

- The `ml` routines now accept `data` as an optional argument, to support
  calls of the form e.g. `ml_linear_regression(y ~ x, data = data)`. This
  should be especially helpful in conjunction with `do`.

- Spark `DenseVector` and `SparseVector` objects are now deserialized as
  R numeric vectors, rather than Spark objects. This should make it easier
  to work with the output produced by `sdf_predict()` with Random Forest
  models, for example.

- Implemented `dim.tbl_spark()`. This should ensure that `dim()`, `nrow()`
  and `ncol()` all produce the expected result with `tbl_spark`s.

- Improved Spark 2.0 installation in Windows by creating spark-defaults.conf
  and configuring spark.sql.warehouse.dir.

- Embedded Apache Spark package dependencies to avoid requiring internet 
  connectivity while connecting for the first thhrough `spark_connect`. The
  `sparklyr.csv.embedded` config setting was added to configure a regular
  expression to match Spark versions where the embedded package is deployed.

- Increased exception callstack and message length  to include full 
  error details when an exception is thrown in Spark.

- Improved validation of supported java versions.

- The `spark_read_csv()` function now accepts the `infer_schema` parameter,
  controlling whether the columns schema should be inferred from the underlying
  file itself. Disabling this should improve performance when the schema is
  known beforehand.

- Added a `do_.tbl_spark` implementation, allowing for the execution of
  `dplyr::do` statements on Spark DataFrames. Currently, the computation is
  performed in serial across the different groups specified on the Spark
  DataFrame; in the future we hope to explore a parallel implementation.
  Note that `do_` always returns a `tbl_df` rather than a `tbl_spark`, as
  the objects produced within a `do_` query may not necessarily be Spark
  objects.

- Improved errors, warnings and fallbacks for unsupported Spark versions.

- `sparklyr` now defaults to `tar = "internal"` in its calls to `untar()`.
  This should help resolve issues some Windows users have seen related to
  an inability to connect to Spark, which ultimately were caused by a lack
  of permissions on the Spark installation.

- Resolved an issue where `copy_to()` and other R => Spark data transfer
  functions could fail when the last column contained missing / empty values.
  (#265)

- Added `sdf_persist()`, as a wrapper to the Spark DataFrame `persist()` API.

- Resolved an issue where `predict()` could produce results in the wrong
  order for large Spark DataFrames.

- Implemented support for `na.action` with the various Spark ML routines. The
  value of `getOption("na.action")` is used by default. Users can customize the
  `na.action` argument through the `ml.options` object accepted by all ML
  routines.

- Fixed windows `spark_connect` with long paths and spaces.

- The `lag()` window function now accepts numeric values for `n`. (#249)

- Added support to configure spark environment variables using `spark.env.*` config.

- Added support for the `Tokenizer` and `RegexTokenizer` feature transformers.
  These are exported as the `ft_tokenizer()` and `ft_regex_tokenizer()` functions.

- Resolved an issue where attempting to call `copy_to()` with an R `data.frame`
  containing many columns could fail with a Java StackOverflow. (#244)

- Resolved an issue where attempting to call `collect()` on a Spark DataFrame
  containing many columns could produce the wrong result. (#242)

- Added support to parameterize network timeouts using the
  `sparklyr.backend.timeout`, `sparklyr.gateway.start.timeout` and
  `sparklyr.gateway.connect.timeout` config settings.

- Improved logging while establishing connections to `sparklyr`.

- Added `sparklyr.gateway.port` and `sparklyr.gateway.address` as config settings.

- Added eclipse project to ease development of the scala codebase within 
  `sparklyr`.

- Added `filter` parameter to `spark_log` to fitler with ease entries by a character
  string.

- Increased network timeout for sparklyr.backend.timeout.

- Moved `spark.jars.default` setting from options to spark config.

- `sparklyr` now properly respects the Hive metastore directory with the
  `sdf_save_table()` and `sdf_load_table()` APIs for Spark < 2.0.0.

- Added `sdf_quantile()` as a means of computing (approximate) quantiles
  for a column of a Spark DataFrame.

- Added support for `n_distinct(...)`, based on call to Hive function
  `count(DISTINCT ...)`. (#220)

# Sparklyr 0.4.0

- First release to CRAN.
