\usage{
ml_kmeans(x, formula = NULL, k = 2L, max_iter = 20L, tol = 1e-04,
  init_steps = 2L, init_mode = "k-means||", seed = NULL,
  features_col = "features", prediction_col = "prediction",

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{spark_connection}, \code{ml_pipeline}, or a \code{tbl_spark}.}

\item{formula}{Used when \code{x} is a \code{tbl_spark}. R formula as a character string or a formula. This is used to transform the input dataframe before fitting, see \link{ft_r_formula} for details.}

\item{k}{The number of clusters to create}

\item{max_iter}{The maximum number of iterations to use.}

\item{tol}{Param for the convergence tolerance for iterative algorithms.}

\item{init_steps}{Number of steps for the k-means|| initialization mode. This is an advanced setting -- the default of 2 is almost always enough. Must be > 0. Default: 2.}

\item{init_mode}{Initialization algorithm. This can be either "random" to choose random points as initial cluster centers, or "k-means||" to use a parallel variant of k-means++ (Bahmani et al., Scalable K-Means++, VLDB 2012). Default: k-means||.}

\item{seed}{A random seed. Set this value if you need your results to be
reproducible across repeated calls.}

\item{features_col}{Features column name, as a length-one character vector. The column should be single vector column of numeric values. Usually this column is output by \code{\link{ft_r_formula}}.}

\item{prediction_col}{Prediction column name.}

\item{uid}{A character string used to uniquely identify the ML estimator.}

\item{...}{Optional arguments; currently unused.}

\item{model}{A fitted K-means model returned by \code{ml_kmeans()}}

\item{dataset}{Dataset on which to calculate K-means cost}
}
\value{
The object returned depends on the class of \code{x}.

\itemize{
  \item \code{spark_connection}: When \code{x} is a \code{spark_connection}, the function returns an instance of a \code{ml_estimator} object. The object contains a pointer to
  a Spark \code{Estimator} object and can be used to compose
  \code{Pipeline} objects.

  \item \code{ml_pipeline}: When \code{x} is a \code{ml_pipeline}, the function returns a \code{ml_pipeline} with
  the clustering estimator appended to the pipeline.

  \item \code{tbl_spark}: When \code{x} is a \code{tbl_spark}, an estimator is constructed then
  immediately fit with the input \code{tbl_spark}, returning a clustering model.

  \item \code{tbl_spark}, with \code{formula} or \code{features} specified: When \code{formula}
    is specified, the input \code{tbl_spark} is first transformed using a
    \code{RFormula} transformer before being fit by
    the estimator. The object returned in this case is a \code{ml_model} which is a
    wrapper of a \code{ml_pipeline_model}. This signature does not apply to \code{ml_lda()}.
}

\code{ml_compute_cost()} returns the K-means cost (sum of
  squared distances of points to their nearest center) for the model
  on the given data.

\description{
K-means clustering with support for k-means|| initialization proposed by Bahmani et al.
  Using `ml_kmeans()` with the formula interface requires Spark 2.0+.
